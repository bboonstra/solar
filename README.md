# SOLAR — Semi-Autonomous Outdoor Life Assisting Robot

SOLAR is a research-driven robotics project aimed at exploring sustainable, autonomous plant care through sensor data collection and environmental interaction. Designed for outdoor environments, OLAR will monitor conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light levels, and take physical actions to support vegetation growth.

## Project Goal

Investigate how robotics can enhance environmental sustainability by automating basic plant care tasks like watering, soil monitoring, and sample collection.

## Key Features

- Modular sensor and actuator integration
- Real-time environmental data collection
- Autonomous decision-making via scheduling and control logic
- Custom-fabricated structural components
- Powered by a Raspberry Pi

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Raspberry Pi
- GPIO, pneumatic actuation, custom servos
- Sensor suite for environmental monitoring
